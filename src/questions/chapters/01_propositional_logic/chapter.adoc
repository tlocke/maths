=== True and false

In the realm of Propositional Logic, I found that they deal with things that are
either true or false. In the English language, sentences that are either true or
false are known as _statements_. Here are some sentences together with
explanations of whether they are statements or not:

[example]
How many miles to Crinnis?

This is a question, so not a statement.

[example]
Elephants have four legs.

Yay, an actual statement! It's a sentence that is either true or false.

[example]
Don't dilly-dally.

This isn't true or false, it sounds like someone admonishing somebody. Not a
statement.

[example]
The capital of France is Paris.

Yes, a statement.

[example]
He likes chocolate.

This sounds like a statement, but according to those logicians in the ivory
tower it doesn't count because it relies on knowing who '`he`' is.

[example]
Don't spoil the ship for a ha'peth of tar.

This is a proverb, not a statement.

I've got this nagging doubt in my mind. Most statements I can think of aren't
_totally_ ambiguous. Take the '`Elephants have four legs`' example. Maybe
there's a three legged elephant in existence, perhaps one in a zoo got
gangrene or something and had to have a leg amputated... Nevertheless, let's
suspend our disbelief and imagine all those perfect statements.

At that point, Alfred Tarski spoke up, '`What about this then?`'.

[example]
This statement is false.

Well, I'm not sure what to do. It seems like a statement, but if it's true then
it's false, and if it's false then it's true! Okay, let's get round it by saying
that this isn't really a statement. What do you think Taski? But Tarski's mind
was on other things...

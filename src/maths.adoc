== Introduction

I'm a mathematical barbarian, but a few days ago I broke into the ivory tower of
mathematics and learnt the basics of Sentential Logic. In order to help me
learn it, I wrote this tutorial. It helped me, and perhaps you'll find it useful
too.

=== Statements

In sentential logic, we're only interested in sentences that are either true
or false. Such sentences are known as _statements_. Here are some sentences
together with explanations of whether they are statements or not:

* _How many miles to Crinnis?_
+
This is a question, so not a statement.

* _Elephants have four legs._
+
Yay, an actual statement! It's a sentence that is either true or false.

* _Don't dilly-dally._
+
This isn't true or false, it sounds like someone admonishing somebody. Not a
statement.

* _The capital of France is Paris._
+
Yes, a statement.

* _He likes chocolate._
+
This sounds like a statement, but according to those logicians in the ivory
tower it doesn't count because it relies on knowing who '`he`' is.

* _Don't spoil the ship for a ha'peth of tar._
+
This is a proverb, not a statement.

I've got this nagging doubt in my mind. Most statements I can think of aren't
_totally_ ambiguous. Take the '`Elephants have four legs`' example. Maybe
there's a three legged elephant in existence, perhaps one in a zoo got
gangrene or something and had to have a leg amputated... Nevertheless, let's
suspend our disbelief and imagine all those perfect statements.

:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Which of the following are statements?
.. Who is John Galt?
.. He's over there.
.. Three divided by three is one.
.. Belgium is a European country.
.. Praise be!
.. Blue is a colour.

. Are the following statements true or false?
.. Four is greater than two.
.. Tennis is a colour.
.. A square has eight sides.
.. A cube has eight corners.
.. Birmingham is a city in England.
.. The word '`rotavator`' is a
      http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/palindrome[palindrome].


:numbered:
=== Connectives

It seems that the next thing the logicians do is string together simple
statements to make compound statements. So two simple statements might be:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee. +
Abelard likes cake.

And a compound statement formed from these two simple statements is:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee and Abelard likes cake.

This compound statement is true if both the simple statements are true,
otherwise it is false. Another compound statement we can make from our two
simple statements is:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee or Abelard likes cake.

This compound statment is false if both simple statements are false, otherwise
it's true. Those mathematicians from the Ivory Tower use the term _connectives_
for the '`and`' and '`or`' that join simple statements to make compound
statements.

:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Are the following compound statements true or false?
.. The film Erin Brokovich stars Julia Roberts and 16 is greater than 4.
.. London is the capital of France or Paris is the capital of France.
.. Some people have brown eyes and humans lay eggs.
.. Four multiplied by two is twenty or it has never rained in Wales.
.. Toothpaste is harder than diamond and less than 100 films have ever been
   made.


:numbered:
=== Formulas

Rather than always writing simple statements out in full, those work-shy
logicians assign a label to them. They call the label an _atomic formula_, and
it can be any capital letter of the alphabet. So for the compound statement:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee and Abelard likes cake.

the two simple statements can have the atomic formulas P and Q:

[example]
P: Abelard likes coffee. +
Q: Abelard likes cake.

and the compound statement can be written as the _formula_:

[example]
P and Q

Now that we've said what P and Q stand for we can take this compound statement:

[example]
Abelard likes coffe or Abelard likes cake.

and write it using the atomic formulas to give the formula:

[example]
P or Q

:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Write the following compound statements as formulas:
.. The film Erin Brokovich stars Julia Roberts and 16 is greater than 4.
.. London is the capital of France or Paris is the capital of France.
.. Some people have brown eyes and humans lay eggs.
.. Four multiplied by two is twenty or it has never rained in Wales.
.. Toothpaste is harder than diamond and less than 100 films have ever been
   made.

:numbered:
=== Funny Symbols

Using formulas does genuinely make it a lot easier to write down statements, I
get that. At the same time though it makes it harder for the uninitiated to
understand what's going on. A bit like jargon. Something else that
mathematicians do takes things even further in this direction of adding mystique
to their subject. Instead of using words for connectives they use obscure
symbols, as if they were sorceresses writing an occult text. So '`and`' is
written {and} and '`or`' is written {or}. Going back to our friend Abelard in
the cafe, the compound statement:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee and Abelard likes cake.

is written in logical symbols as:

[example]
P: Abelard likes coffee. +
Q: Abelard likes cake. +
P {and} Q

and:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee or Abelard likes cake.

is written:

[example]
P: Abelard likes coffee. +
Q: Abelard likes cake. +
P {or} Q

:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Write the answers to the questions for <<_formulas>> in logical symbols.

:numbered:
=== Brackets

In the Tower, they're mad for brackets. They put them round everything in
sight. So instead of writing:

[example]
P {and} Q

they write:

[example]
(P {and} Q)

and instead of:

[example]
P {or} Q

they write:

[example]
(P {or} Q)

I thought all these brackets were a bit over the top at first. A touch of OCD.
Rather fussy. But I found that it makes sense later on when formulas become
more complicated. 


:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Write the answers to the questions for <<_funny_symbols>> using logical
  symbols.


:numbered:
=== Truth Tables

A truth table. A medieval device for extracting a confession? No, a
mathematical device for showing all the possible ways a formula can be true
(T) or false (F). For the two atomic formulas P and Q, the truth table for
(P {and} Q) is:

|===
| P | Q | (P {and} Q)

| T | T | T
| F | T | F
| T | F | F
| F | F | F
|===

so what we've done is written a row for all the combination of true and false
for P and Q, and then in the final column put the value of (P {and} Q). The
truth table for (P {or} Q) is:

|===
| P | Q | (P {or} Q)

| T | T | T
| F | T | T
| T | F | T
| F | F | F
|===

You can use a truth table to show that (P {and} Q) means the same as
(Q {and} P):

|===
| P | Q | (P {and} Q) | (Q {and} P)

| T | T | T | T
| F | T | F | F
| T | F | F | F
| F | F | F | F
|===

For each row of the truth table, the last two columns are the same, and so
(P {and} Q) means the same as (Q {and} P).

:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Use a truth table to show that (P {or} Q) means the same thing as (Q {or} P).


:numbered:
=== Not

There's another connective called _not_, which has the symbol {not}. Its truth
table is:

|===
| P | {not}P

| T | F
| F | T
|===

Let us cast it loose amongst the other connectives and employ the truth table
to see what results. Picking a formula at random, let's try:

[example]
({not}P {or} Q)

which gives the truth table:

|===
| P | Q | {not}P | ({not}P {or} Q)

| T | T | F      | T
| F | T | T      | T
| T | F | F      | F
| F | F | T      | T
|===

Let us now extract a full confession from:

[example]
{not}(P {or} Q)

which gives the truth table:

|===
| P | Q | (P {or} Q) | {not}(P {or} Q)

| T | T | T        | F
| F | T | T        | F
| T | F | T        | F
| F | F | F        | T
|===

One other thing, the first two connectives we encountered ({and} and {or}) both
acted on two formulas, and so they're known as _binary_ connectives. The
{not} connective acts on one formula and so is called a _unary_ connective.


:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Give the truth tables for:
.. {not}(P {and} Q)
.. {not}(P {and} Q)
.. (P {or} {not}Q)
.. {not}{not}P
.. {not}((P {or} Q) {or} R)
.. {not}((P {or} Q) {and} R)


:numbered:
=== Tautology And Contradiction

The formula:

[example]
(P {or} {not}P)

has the truth table:

|===
| P | {not}P | (P {or} {not}P)

| T | F      | T
| F | T      | T
|===

which shows that  whatever the value of P, the formula is always true. In the
Tower they call any formula that's always true a _tautology_. Also, any
formula that's always false they call a _contradiction_. An example of a
contradiction is:

[example]
(P {and} {not}P)

the truth table being:

|===
| P | {not}P | (P {and} {not}P)

| T | F      | F
| F | T      | F
|===

So since the formula is always false, the formula is a contradiction.
 
:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Say whether each of the following formulas is a tautology, a contradiction
  or neither:
.. ((P {and} Q) {and} {not}(P {and} Q))
.. ((P {or} Q) {or} {not}P)
.. ((P {or} Q) {and} {not} P)
.. (({not}P {and} {not}Q) {and} {not}({not}P {and} {not}Q))
.. (({not}P {and} (Q {or} {not}P)) {and} R)


:numbered:
=== Implies

There's another binary connective called _implies_ that has the symbol
{implies}. Its truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | (P {implies} Q)

| T | T | T
| F | T | T
| T | F | F
| F | F | T
|===

Take the two simple statements:

[example]
* Abelard is at the cafe. 
* The cafe is open.

Joining the two with an implication could give the compound statement:

[example]
Abelard is at the cafe only if the cafe is open.

If Abelard really is at the cafe and the cafe really is open, then this
compound statement is true. If Abelard isn't at the cafe, then whether or not
the cafe is open, the compound statement is still true (another way of putting
it is to say that if Abelard is not at the cafe, then this is still consistent
with with the statement that '`Abelard is at the cafe only when the cafe is
open`'). The only time the compound statement is false is if Abelard is at the
cafe but the cafe is not open.

There are a few different ways that '`implies`' occurs in English. The
statement:

[example]
Abelard is at the cafe only if the cafe is open.

could be written in these alternative ways:

[example]
* If Abelard is at the cafe then the cafe is open.
* Abelard being at the cafe implies that the cafe is open.
* The cafe being open is a necessary condition for Abelard to be at the cafe.
* The cafe being open follows from Abelard being at the cafe.

The formula:

[example]
((P {and} {not}Q) {implies} Q)

Has the truth table:

|===
| P | Q | {not}Q | (P {and} {not}Q) | ((P {and} {not}Q) {implies} Q)

| T | T | F      | F              | T
| F | T | F      | F              | T
| T | F | T      | T              | F
| F | F | T      | F              | T
|===

Another example; the truth table for (Q {implies} (P {and} {not}Q)) is:

|===
| P | Q | {not}Q | (P {and} {not}Q) | (Q {implies} (P {and} {not}Q))

| T | T | F      | F              | F
| F | T | F      | F              | F
| T | F | T      | T              | T
| F | F | T      | F              | T
|===

==== Questions

. Write the following English statements as logical formulas:
.. The washing is out only if it's a dry day.
.. If Keith is in Bath, then Keith is in England.
.. The sky being red at night implies that the shepherds are delighted.
. Create a truth table for each of the following formulas:
.. ({not}P {implies} Q)
.. (Q {implies} {not}Q)
.. ((P {implies} Q) {or} P)
.. ({not}(P {and} Q) {implies} ({not}P {or} {not} Q))
.. ((P {and} (P {implies} Q)) {implies} {not}P)


:numbered:
=== Biconditional

The _biconditional_ is a binary connective with the mystical symbol {bicond} and
its truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | (P {bicond} Q)

| T | T | T
| F | T | F
| T | F | F
| F | F | T
|===

Translating from English to logic symbols the sentence:

[example]
It's Christmas Day if and only if it's the 25th of December.

is written:

[example]
P: It's Christmas Day.
Q: It's the 25th of December.
(P {bicond} Q)

which of course is true. An example that is false is:

[example]
It's Christmas Day if and only if it's the 2nd of March.

which is written:

[example]
P: It's Christmas Day.
Q: It's the 2nd of March.
(P {bicond} Q)


:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Translate the following English sentences into logical symbols:
.. The bike's back brake comes on if, and only if, the left brake lever is
   applied.
.. The fridge light is on if, and only if, the fridge door is open.
. Give the truth table for each of the following formulas:
.. (A {bicond} (B {and} C))
.. (B {or} (A {bicond} B))
.. (P {and} {not}(P {bicond} (Q {or} P)))
.. ((Q {bicond} {not}P) {and} (P {bicond} {not} {not}Q))


:numbered:
=== Equivalence

If two formulas are _equivalent_, then the formula formed by joining them with
the {bicond} connective will be a tautology. For example, if the pair of
formulas:

[example]
A and {not}{not}A

are equivalent, then:

[example]
(A {bicond} {not}{not}A)

will be a tautology. Its truth table is:

|===
| A | {not}A | {not}{not}A | (A {bicond} {not}{not}A)

| T | F      | T           | T
| F | T      | F           | T
|===

and so indeed we can say that this pair of formulas are equivalent. The symbol
for equivalence is {equiv}, and so we can write the equivalence of the pair as:

A {equiv} {not}{not}A

Pairs of equivalent formulas can be substituted for each other in other
formulas, without changing the meaning of those other formulas. The commonly
used pairs of equivalent formulas are called _rules of replacement_ (for once
they actually chose a _logical_ name, lol). The equivalent pair that we've just
found:

A {equiv} {not}{not}A

is a rule of replacement called _double {not}_.


:numbered!:
==== Questions

. Use the double {not} rule of replacement to simplify the following formulas:
.. (P {or} {not}{not}Q)
.. {not}{not}(P {or} Q)
.. ({not}{not}A {and} {not}{not}B)


:numbered:
=== Commutativity

Some binary connectives have the property of _commutativity_. The connective
{and} is commutative which means that:

[example]
(A {and} B) {equiv} (B {and} A)

This equivalence is a rule of replacement called _{and} commutativity_. Not all
binary connectives are commutative though. For example:

[example]
(A {implies} B)

is not equivalent to:

(B {implies} A)

because:

(A {implies} B) {bicond} (B {implies} A)

is not a tautology, and so {implies} is not commutative. Here's a table showing
all the binary connectives, and whether they're commutative or not, and if they
are, giving the name of the associated replacement rule.

|===
| Binary Connective | Commutative? | Rule Of Replacement

| {and}             | Yes          | {and} commutativity
| {or}              | Yes          | {or} commutativity
| {implies}         | No           |
| {bicond}           | Yes          | {equiv} commutativity
|===


:numbered!:
==== Questions

. For each of the four binary connectives use a truth table to show if they
  are or are not commutative.


:numbered:
=== Associativity

Another property that some binary connectives have is _associativity_. The
{and} connective is associative, which means:

[example]
(P {and} (Q {and} R)) {equiv} ((P {and} Q) {and} R)

because the formula:

[example]
(P {and} (Q {and} R)) {bicond} ((P {and} Q) {and} R)

is a tautology. So if you've got three formulas joined by {and}, it doesn't
make any difference if you put brackets round the first two or the last two.
This equivalence is a rule of replacement called _{and} associativity_. Here's a
table showing all the binary connectives, and whether they're associative or
not, and if they are, giving the name of the replacement rule:

|===
| Binary Connective | Associative? | Rule Of Replacement

| {and}             | Yes          | {and} associativity
| {or}              | Yes          | {or} associativity
| {implies}         | No           |
| {bicond}          | Yes          | {bicond} associativity
|===

:numbered!:
==== Questions

. For each of the four binary connectives use a truth table to show if they
  are or are not associative (big truth tables ahoy!).


:numbered:
=== Distributivity

Another '`itivity`'. Here are the _distributivity_ rules of replacement:

|===
| Rule Of Replacement | Name

| (A {and} (B {and} C)) {equiv} ((A {and} B) {and} (A {and} C))                     | Distribution of {and} over {and}
| (A {and} (B {or} C)) {equiv} ((A {and} B) {or} (A {and} C))                       | Distribution of {and} over {or}
| (A {or} (B {and} C)) {equiv} ((A {or} B) {and} (A {or} C))                        | Distribution of {or} over {and}
| (A {or} (B {or} C)) {equiv} ((A {or} B) {or} (A {or} C))                          | Distribution of {or} over {or}
| (A {or} (B {or} C)) {equiv} ((A {or} B) {or} (A {or} C))                          | Distribution of {or} over {or}
| (A {implies} (B {implies} C)) {equiv} ((A {implies} B) {implies} (A {implies} C)) | Distribution of {implies} over {implies}
| (A {implies} (B {bicond} C)) {equiv} ((A {implies} B) {bicond} (A {implies} C))     | Distribution of {implies} over {bicond}
| (A {or} (B {bicond} C)) {equiv} ((A {or} B) {bicond} (A {or} C))                 | Distribution of {or} over {bicond}
|===

Here's the pattern as I see it. If there are two connectives x and y, then if
they are distributive 

:numbered:
=== Arguments

The word '`argument`' makes me think of a bitter shouting match. To a logician
it means something altogether more cerebral. A logical argument in English might
be:

[example]
Abelard ordered coffee or Abelard ordered cake. Abelard didn't order cake.
Therefore Abelard ordered coffee.

To convert this argument from English into logical symbols, we first of all
define the atomic formulas:

[example]
A: Abelard ordered coffee. +
B: Abelard ordered cake.

So the argument becomes:

[example]
If A {or} B is true and {not}B is true, then A is true.

To express this argument more concisely we roll out the _double turnstile_ 
symbol {entails}, and write the argument as:

[example]
(A {or} B), {not}B {entails} A

Where the comma-separated list of formulas on the left of the double-turnstile
are the premises, and the formula on the right is the conclusion. That's the
argument written down, but is it valid? In other words, if the premises are
true, is the conclusion true? To find out, we can say that if:

[example]
(((A {or} B) {and} {not}B) {implies} A)

is a tautology, then the argument is valid. If effect we've joined the
premises together with {and} and replaced the {entails} with a {implies} to get
the formula. Bring on the table of truth!

|===
|A | B | (A {or} B) | {not}B | ((A {or} B) {and} {not}B) | (((A {or} B) {and} {not}B) {implies} A)

|T | T | T        | F      | F                       | T
|F | T | T        | F      | F                       | T
|T | F | T        | T      | T                       | T
|F | F | F        | T      | F                       | T
|===

The last column is always true, so the formula is a tautology, so the
argument is valid. Yay! Let's test another argument for validity:

[example]
If we run out of petrol we won't get to the wedding on time. If we lose our
way we won't get to the wedding on time. We've run out of petrol. We won't get
to the wedding on time.

In logic symbols the argument is:

[example]
A: Run out of petrol. +
B: Get to the wedding on time. +
C: Lose our way. +
(A {implies} {not}B), (C {implies} {not}B), A {entails} {not}B

The argument is valid if:

((((A {implies} {not}B) {and} (C {implies} {not}B)) {and} A) {implies} {not}B)

is a tautology. Doing a giant truth table:

|===
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4      | 5                   | 6                   | 7                   | 8               | 9

| A | B | C | {not}B | (A {implies} col_4) | (C {implies} col_4) | (col_5 {and} col_6) | (col_7 {and} A) | (col_8 {implies} col_4)

| T | T | T | F      | F                   | F                   | F                   | F               | T

=== Rules Of Inference

Writing out truth tables gets tedious, especially as the number of rows grows
exponentially with the number of atomic formulas. The logicians have discovered
/ invented an easier way of showing if an argument is valid or not. It involves rewriting the assumptions in a progressively simpler and simpler form until you
end up with the conclusion. The simplifying substitutions are valid arguments
that are known as _rules of inference_. One rule of inference is:

[example]
P, P {implies} Q {entails} Q

You can see this is a valid argument because the expression:

[example]
P {and} (P {implies} Q) {implies} Q

has the truth table:

|===
| P | Q | P {implies} Q | P {and} (P {implies} Q) | P {and} (P {implies} Q) {implies} Q

| T | T | T             | T                       | T
| F | T | T             | F                       | T
| T | F | F             | F                       | T
| F | F | T             | F                       | T
|===

which shows that the expression is a tautology and so the argument is valid.
This rule of inference has the typically recondite name of..._modus ponens_!!!

Another rule of inference is:

[example]
A {and} B {entails} B

and another:

[example]
A {and} B {entails} A

These two rules are called _{and} reduction_. And so, armed with these rules,
lets find out if the following argument is valid:

[example]
A {and} B {implies} A, B {entails} A

The steps to show this is valid are:

. A {and} B {implies} A (assumption)
. B {implies} A (1. and {and} reduction)
. B (assumption)
. A (2. and 3. and modus ponens)

Case solved! Another one:

[example]
Q, (R {and} P) {and} (R {and} Q) {implies} P {entails} P

. (R {and} P) {and} (R {and} Q) {implies} P (assumption)
. R {and} (R {and} Q) {implies} P (1. and {and} reduction)
. R {and} Q {implies} P (2. and {and} reduction)
. Q {implies} P (3. and {and} reduction)
. Q (assumption)
. P (4. and 5. and modus ponens)

Here's a list of rules of inference:

|===
| Name                   | Rule

| Modus ponens           | A {implies} B, A {entails} B
| {implies} introduction | A, B {entails} A {implies} B
| Modus tollens          | A {implies} B, {not}B {entails} {not}A
| Double {not}           | {not}{not}A {entails} A
| {not} elimination      | Assume {not}A, derive B and {not}B {entails} A
| {and} elimination      | A {and} B {entails} A also A {and} B {entails} B
| {and} introduction     | A, B {entails} A {and} B
| {or} elimination       | A {implies} C, B {implies} C, A {or} B {entails} C
| {or} introduction      | A {entails} A {or} B
| {or} syllogism         | A {or} B, {not}B {entails} A

=== Precedence

Let's say we've got _three_ atomic formulas P, Q and R. What's the truth table for:

[example]
P {or} Q {and} R

But wait, do I do the P {or} Q first and then apply the {and} to the result? Or
do I do Q {and} R first and then apply P {or} to the result? And does it even
matter? The Rules Of Propositional Logic that I read while in the Ivory Tower
are quite clear on the point. They say that {and} is evaluated before {or}.
Okay, so the truth table for P {or} Q {and} R is:

|===
| P | Q | R | Q {and} R | P {or} Q {and} R

| T | T | T | T         | T
| F | T | T | T         | T
| T | F | T | F         | T
| F | F | T | F         | F
| T | T | F | F         | T
| F | T | F | F         | F
| T | F | F | F         | T
| F | F | F | F         | F
|===

So what would you write if you want to do P {or} Q and then apply {and} R? The
Rules say that anything in brackets gets evaluated first. So you'd write:

[example]
(P {or} Q) {and} R

and the truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | R | P {or} Q | (P {or} Q) {and} R

| T | T | T | T         | T
| F | T | T | T         | T

I've found that in maths, the same thing is often called different names by
different authors. Also, some authors take different philosophical approaches to
the same area of maths. This point of this section is to help us understand
what other authors are saying, in terms that we already understand.


==== Sentential Logic versus Propositional Logic

Some authors talk of Sentential Logic, and some talk of Propositional Logic.
This is a philosophical difference. Say there are two statements that mean the
same thing but use a different form of words. The sentential school of thought
uses a different label for each statement, but the proposition school would use
just one label.

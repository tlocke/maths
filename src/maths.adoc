== Introduction

I'm a mathematical barbarian, but a few days ago I broke into the ivory tower of
mathematics and learnt the basics of Propositional Logic. In order to help me
learn it, I wrote this tutorial. It helped me, and perhaps you'll find it useful
too.

== Propositions

In propositional logic, we're only interested in sentences that are either true
or false. Such sentences are known as _propositions_. Here are some sentences
together with explanations of whether they are propositions or not:

* _How many miles to Crinnis?_
+
This is a question, so not a proposition.

* _Elephants have four legs._
+
Yay, an actual proposition! It's a sentence that is either true or false.

* _Don't dilly-dally._
+
This isn't true or false, it sounds like someone admonishing somebody. Not a
proposition.

* _The capital of France is Paris._
+
Yes, a proposition.

* _He likes chocolate._
+
This sounds like a proposition, but according to those logicians in the ivory
tower it doesn't count because it relies on knowing who '`he`' is.

* _Don't spoil the ship for a ha'peth of tar._
+
This is a proverb, not a proposition.

I've got this nagging doubt in my mind. Most propositions I can think of aren't
_totally_ ambiguous. Take the '`Elephants have four legs`' example. Maybe
there's a three legged elephant in existence, perhaps one in a zoo got
gangrene or something and had to have a leg amputated... Nevertheless, let's
suspend our disbelief and imagine all those perfect propositions.

=== Questions

. Which of the following are propositions?
.. Who is John Galt?
.. He's over there.
.. Three divided by three is one.
.. Belgium is a European country.
.. Praise be!
.. Blue is a colour.

. Are the following propositions true or false?
.. Four is greater than two.
.. Tennis is a colour.
.. A square has eight sides.
.. A cube has eight corners.
.. Birmingham is a city in England.
.. The word '`rotavator`' is a

== Expressions

It seems that the next thing the logicians do is string together propositions.
They call the result an _expression_. So two propositions might be:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee. +
Abelard likes cake.

And an expression formed from these propositions might be:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee and Abelard likes cake.

This expression is true if both the propositions are true, otherwise it is
false. Another expression we can make from our propositions is:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee or Abelard likes cake.

This expression is false if both propositions are false, otherwise it's true.
Those mathematicians from the Ivory Tower use the term _connectives_ for the
'`and`' and '`or`' that join propositions to make expressions.

=== Questions

. Are the following expressions true or false?
.. The film Erin Brokovich stars Julia Roberts and 16 is greater than 4.
.. London is the capital of France or Paris is the capital of France.
.. Some people have brown eyes and humans lay eggs.
.. Four multiplied by two is twenty or it has never rained in Wales.
.. Toothpaste is harder than diamond and less than 100 films have ever been
   made.


:numbered:
== Labels

Rather than always writing propositions out in full, those work-shy logicians
assign a label to them. So for the expression:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee and Abelard likes cake.

the two propositions can be labelled P and Q:

[example]
P: Abelard likes coffee. +
Q: Abelard likes cake.

and the expression can be written:

[example]
P and Q

Now that we've said what P and Q stand for we write the expression:

[example]
Abelard likes coffe or Abelard likes cake.

and write it using the labels as:

[example]
P or Q

:numbered!:
=== Questions

. For the following expressions, assign labels to the propositions and write the
  expression using the labels.

.. Four multiplied by two is twenty or it has never rained in Wales.
.. Toothpaste is harder than diamond and less than 100 films have ever been
   made.

== Funny Symbols

Using letters of the alphabet to label propositions does genuinely make it a lot
easier to write down expressions, I get that. At the same time though it makes
it harder for the uninitiated to understand what's going on. A bit like jargon.
Something else that mathematicians do takes things even further in this
direction of adding mystique to their subject. Instead of using words for
connectives they use obscure symbols, as if they were sorceresses writing an
occult text. So '`and`' is written {and} and '`or`' is written {or}. Going back
to our friend Abelard in the cafe, the expression:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee and Abelard likes cake.

is written in logical notation as:

[example]
P: Abelard likes coffee. +
Q: Abelard likes cake. +
P {and} Q

and:

[example]
Abelard likes coffee or Abelard likes cake.

is written:

[example]
P: Abelard likes coffee. +
Q: Abelard likes cake. +
P {or} Q

== Truth Tables

A truth table. A medieval device for extracting a confession? No, a
mathematical device for showing all the possible ways an expression can be true
(T) or false (F). For the two propositions P and Q, the truth table for P {and}
Q is:

|===
| P | Q | P {and} Q

| T | T | T
| F | T | F
| T | F | F
| F | F | F
|===

so what we've done is written a row for all the combination of true and false
for P and Q, and then in the final column put the value of P {and} Q. The truth table for P {or} Q is:

|===
| P | Q | P {or} Q

| T | T | T
| F | T | T
| T | F | T
| F | F | F
|===

You can use a truth table to show that P {and} Q means the same as Q {and} P:

|===
| P | Q | P {and} Q | Q {and} P

| T | T | T | T
| F | T | F | F
| T | F | F | F
| F | F | F | F
|===

For each row of the truth table, the last two columns are the same, and so
P {and} Q means the same as Q {and} P.

=== Questions

. Use a truth table to show that P {or} Q means the same thing as Q {or} P.

:numbered:
== Precedence

Let's say we've got _three_ propositions P, Q and R. What's the truth table for:

[example]
P {or} Q {and} R

But wait, do I do the P {or} Q first and then apply the {and} to the result? Or
do I do Q {and} R first and then apply P {or} to the result? And does it even
matter? The Rules Of Propositional Logic that I read while in the Ivory Tower
are quite clear on the point. They say that {and} is evaluated before {or}.
Okay, so the truth table for P {or} Q {and} R is:

|===
| P | Q | R | Q {and} R | P {or} Q {and} R

| T | T | T | T         | T
| F | T | T | T         | T
| T | F | T | F         | T
| F | F | T | F         | F
| T | T | F | F         | T
| F | T | F | F         | F
| T | F | F | F         | T
| F | F | F | F         | F
|===

So what would you write if you want to do P {or} Q and then apply {and} R? The
Rules say that anything in brackets gets evaluated first. So you'd write:

[example]
(P {or} Q) {and} R

and the truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | R | P {or} Q | (P {or} Q) {and} R

| T | T | T | T         | T
| F | T | T | T         | T
| T | F | T | T         | T
| F | F | T | F         | F
| T | T | F | T         | F
| F | T | F | T         | F
| T | F | F | T         | F
| F | F | F | F         | F
|===

:numbered!:
=== Questions

. Write out the truth tables for:
.. P {and} Q {or} R
.. P {and} Q {and} R
.. P {or} Q {or} R
.. P {and} (Q {or} R)


:numbered:
== Not

There's another connective called '`not`'. It has the symbol {not} and the fancy
name '`negation`'. In precedence it is second only to brackets, and its truth
table is:

|===
| P | {not}P

| T | F
| F | T
|===

Let us cast it loose amongst the other connectives and employ the truth table
to see what results. Picking an expression at random, let's try:

[example]
{not}P {or} Q

We know that {not} takes precedence over {or}, so the truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | {not}P | {not}P {or} Q

| T | T | F      | T
| F | T | T      | T
| T | F | F      | F
| F | F | T      | T
|===

Let us now extract a full confession from:

[example]
{not}(P {or} Q)

Brackets take precedence over {not} so the truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | P {or} Q | {not}(P {or} Q)

| T | T | T        | F
| F | T | T        | F
| T | F | T        | F
| F | F | F        | T
|===

One other thing, the first two connectives we encountered ({and} and {or}) both
acted on two propositions, and so they're known as _binary_ connectives. The
{not} connectives acts on one proposition and so is called a _unary_ connective.

:numbered!:
=== Questions

. Give the truth tables for:
.. {not}(P {and} Q)
.. {not}P {and} Q
.. P {or} {not}Q
.. {not}{not}P
.. {not}(P {or} Q {or} R)
.. {not}((P {or} Q) {and} R)

== Tautology And Contradiction

The expression:

[example]
P {or} {not}P

has the truth table:

|===
| P | {not}P | P {or} {not}P

| T | F      | T
| F | T      | T
|===

which shows that  whatever the value of P, the expression is always true. In the
Tower they call any expression that's always true a _tautology_. Also, any
expression that's always false they call a _contradiction_. An example of a
contradiction is:

[example]
P {and} {not}P

the truth table being:

|===
| P | {not}P | P {and} {not}P

| T | F      | F
| F | T      | F
|===

So since the expression is always false, the expression is a contradiction.
 
:numbered!:
=== Questions

. Say whether each of the following expressions is a tautology, a contradiction
  or both:
.. (P {and} Q) {and} {not}(P {and} Q)
.. P {or} Q {or} {not}P
.. P {or} Q {and} {not} P
.. ({not}P {and} {not}Q) {and} {not}({not}P {and} {not}Q)
.. {not}P {and} (Q {or} {not}P) {and} R


:numbered:
== Implies

There's another binary connective called _implies_ that has the symbol {implies}
and in precedence it comes after {or}. Its truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | P {implies} Q

| T | T | T
| F | T | T
| T | F | F
| F | F | T
|===

Take the two propositions:

[example]
* Abelard is at the cafe. 
* The cafe is open.

Joining the two with an implication could give the expression:

[example]
Abelard is at the cafe only if the cafe is open.

If Abelard really is at the cafe and the cafe really is open, then this
expression is true. If Abelard isn't at the cafe, then whether or not the cafe
is open, the expression is still true (another way of putting it is to say that if Abelard is not at the cafe, then this is still consistent with with the
statement that '`Abelard is at the cafe only when the cafe is open`'). The only
time the expression is false is if Abelard is at the cafe but the cafe is not
open.

There are a few different ways that '`implies`' occurs in English. Then
sentence:

[example]
Abelard is at the cafe only if the cafe is open.

could be written in these alternative ways:

[example]
* If Abelard is at the cafe then the cafe is open.
* Abelard being at the cafe implies that the cafe is open.
* The cafe being open is a necessary condition for Abelard to be at the cafe.
* The cafe being open follows from Abelard being at the cafe.

Let's find the truth table for:

[example]
P {and} {not}Q {implies} Q

The {implies} connective is evaluated last, so the truth table is:

|===
| P | Q | {not}Q | P {and} {not}Q | P {and} {not}Q {implies} Q

| T | T | F      | F              | T
| F | T | F      | F              | T
| T | F | T      | T              | F
| F | F | T      | F              | T
|===

Another example; the truth table for Q {implies} P {and} {not}Q is:

|===
| P | Q | {not}Q | P {and} {not}Q | Q {implies} P {and} {not}Q

| T | T | F      | F              | F
| F | T | F      | F              | F
| T | F | T      | T              | T
| F | F | T      | F              | T

:numbered:
== Arguments

The word '`argument`' makes me think of a bitter shouting match. To a logician
it means something altogether more cerebral. A logical argument in English might
be:

[example]
Abelard ordered coffee or Abelard ordered cake. Abelard didn't order cake.
Therefore Abelard ordered coffee.

To convert this argument from English into logical symbols, we first of all
label the propositions:

[example]
A: Abelard ordered coffee. +
B: Abelard ordered cake.

So the argument becomes:

[example]
If A {or} B is true and {not}B is true, then A is true.

To express this argument more concisely we roll out the _semantic turnstile_.
Yes, it really is called that. Anyway, the symbol for the semantic turnstile is
{entails} and the argument can now be written:

[example]
A {or} B, {not}B {entails} A

Where the comma-separated list of expressions on the left of the semantic
turnstile are the assumptions, and the expression on the right is the
conclusion. That's the argument written down, but is it valid? In other words,
if the assumptions are true, is the conclusion true? To find out, we can say
that if:

[example]
(A {or} B) {and} {not}B {implies} A

is a tautology, then the argument is valid. If effect we've joined the
assumptions together with {and} and replaced the {entails} with a {implies} to get
the expressions. Bring on the table of truth!

|===
|A | B | A {or} B | {not}B | (A {or} B) {and} {not}B | (A {or} B) {and} {not}B {implies} A

|T | T | T        | F      | F                       | T
|F | T | T        | F      | F                       | T
|T | F | T        | T      | T                       | T
|F | F | F        | T      | F                       | T
|===

The last column is always true, so the expression is a tautology, so the
argument is valid. Yay! Let's test another argument for validity:

[example]
If we run out of petrol we won't get to the wedding on time. If we lose our
way we won't get to the wedding on time. We've run out of petrol. We won't get
to the wedding on time.

In logic symbols the argument is:

[example]
A: Run out of petrol. +
B: Get to the wedding on time. +
C: Lose our way. +
A {implies} {not}B, C {implies} {not}B, A {entails} {not}B

The argument is valid if:

(A {implies} {not}B) {and} (C {implies} {not}B) {and} A {implies} {not}B

is a tautology. Doing a giant truth table:

|===
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4      | 5                 | 6                 | 7                 | 8             | 9

| A | B | C | {not}B | A {implies} col_4 | C {implies} col_4 | col_5 {and} col_6 | col_7 {and} A | col_8 {implies} col_4

| T | T | T | F      | F                 | F                 | F                 | F             | T
| F | T | T | F      | T                 | F                 | F                 | F             | T
| T | F | T | T      | T                 | F                 | F                 | F             | T
| F | F | T | T      | T                 | T                 | T                 | F             | T
| T | T | F | F      | F                 | T                 | F                 | F             | T
| F | T | F | F      | T                 | T                 | T                 | F             | T
